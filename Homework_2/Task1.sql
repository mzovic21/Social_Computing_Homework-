/*Exercise 2.1 Growth: This year, we are renting 16 servers to run our social media platform. They are soon at 100% capacity, 
so we need to rent more servers. We would like to rent enough to last for 3 more years without upgrades, plus 20% capacity for 
redundancy. We need an estimate of how many servers we need to start renting based on past growth trends. Plot the trend on a 
graph using Python and include it below. Answer and explain your queries/calculations below. You may use SQL and/or Python to 
perform this task. (Note that the dataset may not end in the current year, please assume that the last data marks todayâ€™s date)
